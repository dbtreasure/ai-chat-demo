# Paxton.ai Front End Test

## Configuration

Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the values. This is a demo app and it is extremely unsafe to use an API key directly here, and would instead be found on a server. Best practice would be to initiate a new OPENAI key for running this, then when finished delete the key to insure no one else can use it.

## Installation

`pnpm install`
`pnpm run dev`

## Testing

`pnpm run test`
